# Efficiency Benchmarking

Ever get into stupid conversations about asinine things? Sometimes it's at the bar and sometimes it's at work. Such as:

1. We should always use single quotes because they're more efficient.
2. While() loops are more efficient than foreach() loops. We should only use while() loops. 
3. Print is slower than echo. 
4. Avoid using the following because they're slow:
	- regular expressions
	- encryption
	- random number generators

Like when Guinness created the "Guinness Book of World Records" to settle arguments at bars this project was created to settle arguments 
about what is slow in software. What matters and what doesn't?
